# Video Player Layout

A simple exercise to demonstrate adaptable layouts in React (using CSS) for a Video player with additional video thumbnail images in a sidebar.

## The Toggle Button:

* Position the ‘toggle’ button to display over the player UI at the top left.
* The button should always be visible and clickable.
* Clicking the ‘toggle’ button should show/hide the side-panel.
* The player UI should animate between the two states.

## The Player:

* The player should take up the entire width and height of the window when the side-panel is hidden.
* When the side-panel is visible, the player should still take up the entire height of the window, but the width should be adjusted to account for the side panel.
* The player should always be visible in its entirety. It should not crop and it should not require you to scroll to view any part of it.

## The Side-panel:

* The side-panel should always be 320px wide when visible and the entire height of the window.
* The contents of the side-panel should scroll when its height exceeds the height of the window.
